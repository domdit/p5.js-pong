# p5js-pong
This is a simple pong game made with the p5js library.

### Motivaton
This is one of my first projects with not only the p5js library, but also one of my first video games (that wasn't text based, you will see my text-based rpg soon enough ;) ). I wanted to break into implementing simple physics with a video game and figured why not try the old clasic, Pong.

### Libraries
p5js - https://p5js.org/
